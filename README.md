# Tetris-like game

This was the final project from my high school AP Computer Science class. Some of the implementation could be improved, considering it was written back when I had a lot less experience, but I still enjoyed the project and enjoy messing around with it from time to time. I am putting it up here on gitub so others can play with it, too.

Note on the github version

  - In my original project, the audio files that played by default were the Tetris theme, with an alternate audio of Viva la Vida by Coldplay. Because I do not own the rights to either song, I have replaced the audio files with white noise. To get your own audio, replace "AudioOne.wav" and "AudioTwo.wav" with wahtever you want.

# How to Play

  - The Tetris-like game will start when the TetrixBoard.java class is run.
  - The left and right arrow keys will move Tetriminos left and right, respectively
  - The down arrow key will "soft drop" (move a piece one square down)
  - The up arrow key will "hard drop" (place a piece all the way down)
  - The space bar will rotate Tetriminos
# Other Functionality
  - The "H" Key will initiate the Hold
  - The "P" Key will pause/play your current game
  - The "N" key while paused or after a game will restart a new game
  - Pressing the "Q" key while playing will queue up a straight piece as the next Tetrimino off screen
    - This cheat code was fun while debugging but also allowed me to get much higher scores

# Audio Controls
  - The "M" key will mute/unmute the audio playback
  - The "V" key will toggle between AudioOne and AudioTwo
